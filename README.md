# Ride Sharing System (C++ & Smalltalk)

This project implements a Ride Sharing simulation demonstrating core OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation**: Hides ride data and manages access through methods.
- **Inheritance**: `StandardRide` and `PremiumRide` extend the `Ride` base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Fare calculations are dynamically bound at runtime.

Each part builds incrementally:
- `2.1`: Base class definition
- `2.2`: Subclass and polymorphism
- `2.3`: Driver encapsulation
- `2.4`: Rider management
- `2.5`: Full system integration

To run:
1. Compile `.cpp` files using an online C++ compiler or terminal.
2. Execute Smalltalk scripts in **GNU Smalltalk**.
3. Output screenshots included in `/docs/screenshots`.
